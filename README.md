## User Stories

- as a competitive user I want a round tracker so I can see how far I've gotten
- as a user I want a dark mode so i can play the game without eye strain
### MVP Goals
- Building a board 
- Having the buttons light up and keep track of the pattern that ran
- Interactive buttons for the user to duplicate the pattern
- The board to let the user know if they were correct or incorrect
### Stretch Goals
Bronze:
- keeping track of users highest previous round
- making the game begin to look nice
Silver:
- setting a time limit on users feedback
- making a harder mode(faster light change)
Gold:
- better styling
- adding on to the user previous round high by adding the time it took for them to get there
- allowing a user to set a pattern and having it replay for a friend to then have to copy back
